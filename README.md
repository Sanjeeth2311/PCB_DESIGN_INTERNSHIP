# PCB Design Internship Projects

## About This Repository

This repository contains my PCB design projects and files created during a **6-month internship** focused on Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design.

The internship emphasized hands-on practice in:
- PCB design principles and best practices
- Design standards and guidelines
- Layout techniques and tips
- Manufacturing standards (e.g., DRC rules, fabrication constraints)
- 2-layer and 4-layer PCB designs

The first 4 months were dedicated to learning and practicing these fundamentals through various exercises and small projects. The remaining time involved applying these skills to more complex designs.

All designs in this repository are my personal practice work from the internship. They showcase my progression in PCB design skills using tools like KiCad (or specify your tool if different, e.g., Altium Designer).

## Repository Structure

Each project folder typically contains:
- Schematic files
- PCB layout files
- Gerber files
- BOM
- 3D View
- Individual READMEs with project-specific details

## Tools Used

- **KiCad** 
- Gerber viewers for validation
- Any additional libraries or plugins

## Learning Outcomes

Through this internship, I gained practical experience in:
- Creating clean, manufacturable 2-layer and 4-layer PCBs
- Applying layout best practices (signal integrity, power distribution, grounding)
- Following industry manufacturing standards (e.g., trace width, clearance, via sizes)
- Debugging designs with DRC/ERC checks

Feel free to explore the designs, and feedback is welcome!
